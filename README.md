# Charlotte-Card-Flip

Welcome to Charlotte Card Flip: a memory game for two players.

![Charlotte Card Flip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pawhurr/Charlotte-Card-Flip/master/images/Capture.png)

The first player selects a card and it flips over.  The first player then selects a second card that flips over.  If those cards match, they are removed and the player scores a point.  If not, the two cards flip back over and the second player has a turn.  The player with the most correct matches wins.  After the game is over, if players would like to play again, click the "Play Again?" button and the cards will shuffle and start again.

This game utilizes vanilla JavaScript and jQuery for logic and DOM manipulation and CSS with a Bootstrap framework for all animations and styling.
