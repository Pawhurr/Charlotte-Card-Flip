# Charlotte-Card-Flip

Welcome to Charlotte Card Flip: a memory game for two players.

The first player selects a card and it flips over.  The first player then selects a second card that flips over.  If those cards match, they score a point.  If not, the two cards flip back over and the second player has a turn.  The player with the most correct matches wins.
